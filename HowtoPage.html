                        <p> <b> What did you add to your website that the user will see?</b> Today I made a side navbar, that can be pulled out from the side. A classmate sent me a link to a video that explained how to do it with the code attached, so I used
                            that and adjusted it to fit my theme. I also decided on and made a consistent color scheme of dark slate grey and 2 different shades of lavender. The decision was the hardest part. I also put my pictures in the boxes, like
                            I had planned, and centered these boxes, which is what I was having trouble with yesterday. Finally, I also put my name at the top and put it on the right side, so it can be seen (it couldn’t before because of the navbar tab).


                            <b> What code did you add to your pages?  Break it down into explainable chunks and include the explanations of what it does and how.</b> I used a line break (br) to make space between my boxes, and put the pictures further
                            down so that the text was all together. I used a divider (div) around each of my tables, I think to put the pictures into the boxes, and to be able to center the boxes. I also made the pop out menu bar, but it has a really,
                            really long code.

                                Today I didn't add anything to my website, but I worked on and finished the hardware plan. To do this, I had to research and take notes about different parts of a computer, including the Motherboard, CPU, RAM, and Hard Drive.
                                I also made the layout for this page, which is pretty much based on the About Me page layout.

                            <p><b>What did you add to your website that the user will see?  Text, images, positions, borders, colors, etc.  Be specific.</b> 
                            I made everything for my hardware page, including boxes that each subject goes in.
                                
                                <b>What code did you add to your pages?  Break it down into explainable chunks and include the explanations of what it does and how.</b> 

                                First, I made a new file for the hardware page by choosing "HTML file" in the "New from Template" part of "File". I renamed this "hardware.html" 
                                so I knew what page I was using. I also had to link this page in the navbar of the About Me page. Next, I copied and
                                pasted the style and navbar parts of my about me page file into the new hardware.html file. I also copied the format I had used for the 
                                About Me page, which was using tables, which seemed to work, but I later learned that these don't work well as a format, which is 
                                when you are supposed to use "divs" instead. However, there didn't seem to be any problems, so I used tables anyway, also because I still
                                didn't know about divs. When I put pictures in, I used (width="60%”) to make them smaller, and I experimented with the width and height to 
                                see how they'd best fit. I used (style="margin-right:5px") to add space between the words and the border, which took a long time to figure out, but 
                                it makes the overall page look less cramped and just better. A problem I faced was that I used tables to make this page, which was confusing 
                                because the teacher didn’t know how to navigate using tables as well as with using divs, so now I have to learn how divs work.
                                
                                <b>What else would be useful to have or remember to make a great ‘How To’ blog page?</b>
                                It would be useful to remember how to put pictures next to text, which I learned today.

                                 Today I finished the Hardware Page, because yesterday I had only finished the first three sections, the motherboard, CPU, and RAM. So, 
                                 the sections I finished today were the hard drive, keyboard, monitor, and mouse. I copied and pasted the format from the other sections 
                                 and changed the information to match the section I was working on. 

                                <b>What code did you add to your pages?  Break it down into explainable chunks and include the explanations of what it does and how.</b>
                                I used tables to organize this information, which, like I said in the last section, didn't work as well as it could've, but I didn't 
                                experience any major roadblocks. The tag for a table is (table), with the parentheses being greater than/less than symbols. In the table, 
                                I made table headers, the tag of which is (th). In these I put the title of the section, and "What is a ______ and what does it do?"
