                            put my pictures in the boxes, like I had planned, and centered these boxes, which is what I was having trouble with yesterday. Finally, I also put my name at the top and put it on the right side, so it can be seen (it couldn’t
                            before because of the navbar tab).

                            <br> used this to make space between my boxes, and put the pictures further down so that the text was all together. This tag means line break, I think.

I made everything for my hardware page, including boxes that each subject goes in.

width="60%” I used this to make my pictures smaller; I experimented with the width and height.
style="margin-right:5px">  I used this to add space between the words and the border
I used tables to make this page, which was confusing because the teacher didn’t know how to navigate using tables as well as with using divs, so now I have to learn how to do that.
